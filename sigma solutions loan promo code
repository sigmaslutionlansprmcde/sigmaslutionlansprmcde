Payactiv, DailyPay and One@Work (formerly Even) are three popular earned wage access companies.

Payactiv lets employees access up to 50% of their daily net earnings on all work days. Transfers usually take one to three business days, but employees can transfer funds immediately for no fee or a fee of $1.99 or $2.99, depending on how you receive the funds and whether you have direct deposit set up.

DailyPay decides how much of your earnings you can have deposited when you make a request. Users can get their funds instantly for a fee up to $3.99 or on the next business day for a fee up to $1.99.

One@Work lets employees access up to 50% of their paycheck and says users can receive funds instantly for a fee. If users donâ€™t want to pay the fee, transfers take one business day, according to the company.
